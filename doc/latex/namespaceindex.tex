\doxysubsubsection{Detailed Description}
This script reads a CSV file containing data on the number of vehicles and their speeds, and generates a plot with different elements. 

The script reads a CSV file with the following format\+: num\+Car;density;speed1;speed2;...;speedN
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item num\+Car\+: Number of vehicles (integer)
\item density\+: Density value (float)
\item speed1, speed2, ..., speedN\+: Speed values in m/s (float) The script converts the speed values from m/s to km/h and generates a plot with the following elements\+:
\item Vertical bars representing individual data points (speeds) for each num\+Car
\item A red line representing the mean speed for each num\+Car
\item A green line representing the trend line (interpolation) for the mean speed
\item Purple dashed lines representing the standard deviation bands (Â±1 standard deviation)
\item X-\/axis labels showing "{}num\+Car (density)"{} for each num\+Car
