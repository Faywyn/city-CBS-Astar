\doxysection{Get information out of XML}
\hypertarget{_example_3}{}\label{_example_3}\index{Get information out of XML@{Get information out of XML}}
 In this example, we navigate a simple XML file, and read some interesting text. Note that this example doesn\textquotesingle{}t use error checking; working code should check for null pointers when walking an XML tree, or use \doxylink{classtinyxml2_1_1_x_m_l_handle}{XMLHandle}.

(The XML is an excerpt from "{}dream.\+xml"{}).


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 The structure of the XML file is\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item (declaration) 
\item (dtd stuff) 
\item Element "{}\+PLAY"{} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Element "{}\+TITLE"{} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Text "{}\+A Midsummer Night\textquotesingle{}s Dream"{} 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

For this example, we want to print out the title of the play. The text of the title (what we want) is child of the "{}\+TITLE"{} element which is a child of the "{}\+PLAY"{} element.

We want to skip the declaration and dtd, so the method First\+Child\+Element() is a good choice. The First\+Child\+Element() of the Document is the "{}\+PLAY"{} Element, the First\+Child\+Element() of the "{}\+PLAY"{} Element is the "{}\+TITLE"{} Element.


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 We can then use the convenience function Get\+Text() to get the title of the play.


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 Text is just another Node in the XML DOM. And in fact you should be a little cautious with it, as text nodes can contain elements.

\begin{DoxyVerb}Consider: A Midsummer Night's <b>Dream</b>
\end{DoxyVerb}


It is more correct to actually query the Text Node if in doubt\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 Noting that here we use First\+Child() since we are looking for \doxylink{classtinyxml2_1_1_x_m_l_text}{XMLText}, not an element, and To\+Text() is a cast from a Node to a \doxylink{classtinyxml2_1_1_x_m_l_text}{XMLText}.
