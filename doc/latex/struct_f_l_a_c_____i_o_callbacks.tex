\doxysubsubsection{Detailed Description}
A structure for holding a set of callbacks. Each FLAC interface that requires a \doxylink{struct_f_l_a_c_____i_o_callbacks}{FLAC\+\_\+\+\_\+\+IOCallbacks} structure will describe which of the callbacks are required. The ones that are not required may be set to NULL.

If the seek requirement for an interface is optional, you can signify that a data sorce is not seekable by setting the {\itshape seek} field to {\ttfamily NULL}.
